# Anomaly Detection and Unsupervised Learning
## Goal

1. Appreciate how to formulate 
2. Understand how to evaluate models
3. 

## Why anomaly detection?


## Formulating problems

### Guiding questions
1. What do the "bad guys" look like? (Or what is your threat scenario)
2. 

## Evaluating models
A common mistake: wrong evaluation metric. Or attempt to detect all anomalies.

Example: Statistics done Wrong
If we have 1000 patients, and 10 of them have cancer. We have a test (model) that detects cancer, with the following
1. If a patient (true positive)
2. If a pa (false positive)

In the case of cyber logs, we can expect 

In the context of anomaly detection, we have to be . For instance, accuracy
